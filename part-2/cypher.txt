Logic:
1-Each letter in the alphabet has a corresponding character in the key, spaces are represented by #
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz! = alphabet
9876543210zyxwvutsrqponmlkj = key
2-The converted string is split in half and the second half is put in from of the first. If its odd numbered the first half gets the extra character
3-Then the converted string is reversed
